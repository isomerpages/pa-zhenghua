"Lean On Me” is a resident-centred initiative that aims to support and promote mental wellbeing in our community. Our main goal is to create a positive and joyful living environment for all.

To achieve this, we have created a dedicated website that serves as a valuable customised resource portal. The content on this website has been carefully chosen based on discussions with residents. It provides useful information about resources available in the areas of Holland-Bukit Timah GRC and Bukit Panjang SMC.

The website offers a variety of things, such as activities, assistance programs, and video interviews with our own residents sharing their experiences and best practices on mental wellbeing. These videos aim to reduce the stigma around struggling and encourage people to seek help when they need it. We hope that this platform can be a starting point for everyone, providing basic information on finding relaxation and seeking assistance.

To prioritise our wellbeing as a community, it’s important that we come together and help those in need. We also invite residents who are interested to become befrienders. Let’s join forces and embark on this journey together, promoting a culture of support and compassion. By doing so, we can create an environment where we all feel valued, cared for, and empowered to overcome challenges in life.
