<h2>Welcome to BP Sedap!</h2><blockquote><h4><em>Made by Neighbours, for Neighbours</em></h4></blockquote><p>This is a community-led initiative led by Zhenghua for our Bukit Panjang town, supported by North West CDC, to uplift our home bakers and cooks.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="bp sedap" src="/images/BP_Sedap_1.JPEG"></div><p>BP Sedap! was rolled out during the Covid-19 pandemic when businesses were affected and many residents lost their main source of income. We brought together home bakers and cooks to participate in food hygiene courses and photography, marketing and networking workshops to help them upskill and supplement their income during this difficult time.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="bp sedap" src="/images/BP_Sedap_banner.png"></div><p>Our Facebook platform allows registered home bakers and cooks to showcase and sell their food in the neighbourhood. We are happy to see residents coming to support bakers and cooks by buying home made food and connecting with one another.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Click <a href="https://go.gov.sg/bpsedap" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to join our Facebook group and show your support.&nbsp; <br></strong></p><p><strong>Click </strong><a href="https://go.gov.sg/bukitpanjangsedap" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a><strong> to register as one of our home bakers and cooks. </strong></p><p><em>Interested residents are required to obtain WSQ Statement of Attainment (SOA) for either Follow Food &amp; Beverage Safety Hygiene Policies and Procedures or Food Safety Course.&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p>
