<p>In collaboration with SPH Media and Auresys Pte Ltd, Project Sama Sama
@ North West has come to Zhenghua, launched on 6 July 2024 with the support
of our grassroots volunteers!</p>
<p></p>
<h4>What is <strong>Project Sama Sama @ North West</strong>? </h4>
<p>Project Sama Sama extends 24/7 assistance to identified resource-low households
through vending machines stocked with daily essentials such as fresh food,
toiletries, hygiene and cleaning products. These residents will receive
complimentary credits at the start of each month to redeem these necessities
at their convenience.</p>
<p>The word "Sama Sama" simply means togetherness and fostering a sense of
community.</p>
<p>This collaboration provides additional support to help our residents cope
with the rising cost of living and the stress of daily expenses, complementing
other modes of assistance.</p>
<p>Our vending machines are located at Block 634B Senja Road.</p>
