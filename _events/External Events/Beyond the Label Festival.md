#### Beyond the Label Festival (BTL Fest) is back! 
**And we want YOU to join us**.

The annual signature event seeks to rally greater community support and help-seeking behaviour by advocating for awareness surrounding the stigma experienced by persons with mental health conditions.  BTL Fest is a non-ticketed event and open to people of all ages.

Held at the Jewel Changi Airport, BTL Fest will feature educational workshops, booths, games, and performances to promote mental wellbeing, provide greater knowledge and a safe space for participants to have conversations about mental health, and find out where to seek help.

This year’s theme, ‘**Mental Wellness Begins with All of Us**’, highlights that mental wellness is a shared responsibility. It starts with each of us taking small steps in our homes, schools, neighbourhoods, and workplaces.

When everyone plays a part by being non-judgmental, compassionate, and supportive, we can build a society that fosters understanding and promotes social inclusion and empowers persons with mental health conditions to lead fulfilling lives.
