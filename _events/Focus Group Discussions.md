In pursuit of a strategic and targeted approach, an essential component of our methodology involved the conduct of focus group discussions (FGD). These deliberative sessions served as a valuable means to collect indispensable findings and insights. The information garnered therein became the bedrock upon which the committee meticulously crafted and programmed a series of purposeful strategic events, meticulously tailored to cater to the distinct needs of our esteemed residents.


Through the discerning lens of these focus group discussions, our collective comprehension transcended mere surface observations, allowing us to delve into the intricacies of the daily experiences encountered by our community members. Of particular significance, we gleaned profound understanding regarding the challenges our residents confront in regard to their mental wellbeing on a routine basis.


It is with great conviction and a profound sense of responsibility that we forge ahead, utilizing the knowledge gleaned from the focus group discussions as a catalyst for transformative change. Our mission is resolute: to implement initiatives that nurture mental wellbeing, in tandem with our overarching objective of enhancing the overall quality of life for our residents.
