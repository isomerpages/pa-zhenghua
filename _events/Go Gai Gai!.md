In our ongoing commitment to fostering mental wellness among young individuals, we have initiated a program aimed at training our local youth befrienders from West Spring and Zhenghua Secondary. This training encompasses the utilisation of nature-led conversations and activities as effective tools for promoting mental wellbeing.

It is imperative to emphasise that our intention extends beyond the immediate term, as we are steadfast in our dedication to establishing a sustainable program that will endure beyond the confines of this initial initiative. Our partnership with Zhenghua Youth Networks ensures the sustainability and continued provision of mental health support and the promotion of holistic wellbeing for years to come.
