Breathwork and meditation deepened relaxation, improved mood, and soothed physical illness.

Breathing was something we constantly did, often without paying any attention to it. Breathwork involved consciously and mindfully changing our breathing patterns to improve relaxation. Coupled with meditation, which calmed the mind, we could help soothe our nervous system.

There were many reported benefits of breathwork and meditation, from reducing stress and anxiety to improving sleep and mood. It also may have helped with the symptoms of certain physical illnesses.
