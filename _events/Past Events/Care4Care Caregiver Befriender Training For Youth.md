Embarked on a profound exploration of self-awareness and empathy with our transformative workshop. This immersive experience invited participants to delve into a journey of introspection and connection, guided by a carefully crafted program. The workshop began with a comprehensive briefing, setting the stage for the group discussions and collaborative activities, participants were introduced to the concept of creating a safe space using natural materials, fostering a supportive atmosphere that laid the groundwork for personal growth and understanding.

As the workshop progressed, co-facilitation training unfolded, employing reflection and role play to illuminate the importance of empathy and engagement. Participants stepped into various roles, such as Facilitator, Observer, and Participants, gaining valuable insights into effective communication and interpersonal dynamics. The workshop concluded with a sharing session, providing each youth with a personal toolkit—comprising a journal book, markers, washi tapes, and prompt cards—to capture and reflect on their experiences. This unique blend of self-reflection and collaborative learning equipped participants with not only heightened self-awareness but also the tools to cultivate empathy, fostering a more compassionate and understanding community among Youth Befrienders.
