Our workshop, "Track of Life: Mapping Self-Awareness and Empathy with Youth Befrienders," offered participants a transformative journey into self-awareness and empathy. This immersive experience guided individuals through introspective moments and meaningful connections, all orchestrated by a carefully crafted program. Commencing with a comprehensive briefing, the workshop set the stage for a nature walk that encouraged keen observation and connection with the surrounding environment. Through dynamic group discussions and collaborative activities, participants were introduced to the concept of constructing a secure space using natural materials, fostering an atmosphere conducive to personal growth and understanding.

The workshop progressed seamlessly into co-facilitation training, where reflection and role play illuminated the paramount importance of empathy and meaningful engagement. Participants assumed diverse roles, including Facilitator, Observer, and Participants, gaining invaluable insights into effective communication and interpersonal dynamics. Bringing the experience to a close, a sharing session provided each youth with a personalized toolkit—comprising a journal book, markers, washi tapes, and prompt cards—to document and reflect on their unique journey. This distinctive blend of nature immersion, self-reflection, and collaborative learning not only elevated participants' self-awareness but also equipped them with the essential tools to nurture empathy, thereby fostering a community of compassion and understanding among Youth Befrienders.
