Welcomed the day with tranquility through "Sunrise Yoga &amp; Conversations on Mental Wellbeing." Participants joined us for a revitalizing experience as the sun painted the sky with warm hues. This unique session not only fostered physical well-being but also opened a space for meaningful conversations about mental health. 

Designed to encourage long-term practice, the yoga routine provided easy movements that could be seamlessly incorporated into daily routines at home, promoting independent well-being. Participants connected with other beginners on a similar journey, sharing experiences and supporting one another as they embarked on a path to improved mental health. Embraced the dawn with a blend of gentle yoga, mindful conversations, and the promise of brighter, more balanced days ahead.
