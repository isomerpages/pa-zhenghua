This program was co-created with local textile artist, Izziyana Suhaimi. Participants were introduced to her practice of breathing life into old items by using them as art materials instead of discarding them.

Participants learned about the dangers of fast fashion and engaged in a meaningful activity of upcycling old textiles or shoelaces, that would otherwise be discarded, into beautiful pieces of art/products. They were guided through how to transform used items such as old t-shirts or shoelaces into a ball of yarn and learned macrame and knotting techniques.

The outcome of this workshop was highly customizable. A choice of a keychain or accessories to a wall hanging piece of art, participants enjoyed the fun of upcycling and considered ways of bringing new life to a used item before discarding them!
