### **Spark the Change Fest 2023**
In Singapore, the number of people taking their own lives increased by 25.9 per cent last year, reaching a total of 476 cases. This marks [the highest number since 2000](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/singapore-highest-suicide-deaths-478-cases-2022-021632405.html), translating to more than one person losing their life to suicide each day.

In conjunction with World Suicide Prevention Day on 10 September, the non-profit suicide prevention centre SOS has taken the initiative to organise the Spark the Change Fest 2023. The primary aim of this event is to bring the community together and offer support to individuals struggling with suicidal thoughts or grappling with its aftermath, according to SOS.

Now in its second year, the event starts with a 3km charity walk called #HOWRU. Additionally, wellness activities such as a [Yoga](https://sg.style.yahoo.com/free-yoga-classes-in-singapore-to-get-you-started-this-international-yoga-day-081526555.html) Workshop and performances by artists like [Benjamin Kheng](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/singapore-artiste-benjamin-kheng-freelancer-business-owner-055954608.html) are scheduled throughout the day.

The main aim of the festival is to break down the stigma surrounding conversations about mental health and foster a positive impact.

Make sure to mark your calendars for [2 September](https://www.facebook.com/SamaritansOfSingapore/posts/pfbid023MwQFZRCxtjZw4U5VeWZb5LyoZsWoJaHvz41WbHeqMqYdEM22fLrYi95PVEBXVPgl?ref=embed_post), from 9am to 9pm at OCBC Square in the Singapore Sports Hub!
