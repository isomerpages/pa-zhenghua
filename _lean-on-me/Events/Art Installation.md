We believe that art has a unique power to heal and connect us on a deeper level. Our crochet art installation is not just about splashing colours across the canvas; it's an enthralling fusion of creativity and compassion. Picture this: the streets adorned with vibrant, whimsical crochet art installations that represent more than just a feast for the eyes. Each piece weaves an intricate story, touching upon themes close to our heartsâ€”mental health, understanding, empathy, and belonging.

Today, we stand in awe of the collective effort and dedication put forth by these 100 residents who have poured their hearts into Lean On Me's crochet art installations. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to each and every contributor, as this installation stands as a living testament to the power of unity and the transformational impact of community-driven initiatives.
