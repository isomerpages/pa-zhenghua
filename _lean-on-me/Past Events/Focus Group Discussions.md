In pursuit of a strategic and targeted approach, an essential component of our methodology involved the conduct of focus group discussions (FGDs). These deliberative sessions served as a valuable means to collect findings and insights. The information garnered became the bedrock upon which our committee meticulously crafted and programmed a series of purposeful events, tailored to cater to the distinct needs of our residents.

Through the discerning lens of these focus group discussions, we transcended mere surface observations, delving into the intricacies of the daily experiences encountered by our community members, and the challenges they confront on a routine basis with regard to their mental wellbeing.

We forge ahead with conviction and a sense of responsibility, the knowledge from the focus group discussions serving as a catalyst for transformative change. Our mission is to implement initiatives that nurture mental wellbeing, in tandem with our overarching objective of enhancing the overall quality of life for our residents.
