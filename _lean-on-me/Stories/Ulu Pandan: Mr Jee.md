<p>Mr. Jee, not only a Grassroots Leader in Ulu Pandan but also a fervent
mental health advocate, has been vocal about the challenges surrounding
mental well-being.
<br>
<br>Over the past generations, there were widespread misconceptions, but with
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the importance of mental health
became glaringly apparent. Isolation and lack of interaction exacerbated
depression and anxiety, prompting a shift in public perception towards
mental health first aid.
<br>
<br>As part of the Mental Wellness Taskforce, Mr. Jee and his team have spearheaded
inclusive initiatives and informed residents about available mental health
resources. He emphasises the need for an open-minded approach towards mental
health and encourages individuals to step out of their comfort zones to
foster community interactions.
<br>
<br>Let's join Mr. Jee in advocating for mental well-being and building supportive
communities together!</p>
