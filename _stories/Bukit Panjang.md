Angel's journey of helping friends with mental health issues began in Primary 4, when she supported a friend who was self-harming and engaging in dangerous online challenges. This experience had a profound impact on Angel, who began to experience her own mental health challenges. In Primary 6, Angel's struggles came to a head when she began to have thoughts of self-harm. Initially, she was scared to reach out to her mother, but to her surprise, her mother was understanding and supportive. She even found a psychologist to work through her issues. Today, Angel is doing better, and she is both supporting and being supported by her family and friends.
