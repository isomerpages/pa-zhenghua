Fion got married at 17 years old. She got pregnant but didn’t want to be a single mother, so she got an abortion. It took another 10 years before she conceived another baby. Unfortunately, it passed at 4 months with no heartbeat. It broke her. While her friends were starting families, she cried every day. She stayed at home and didn’t talk to people. She lost the ability to eat, to take showers – to live. It took a toll on her husband too, but neither of them talked to each other. She blamed herself, and everyone else around her. She blamed feng shui, her ancestors, and her husband. She even went into a depression without her even knowing.

Eventually, she slowly started to pull herself out of this slump by focusing all her energy on charity, at orphanages. She decided she could pour her love on others even if I didn’t have kids. So she started Keeping Hope Alive, an organisation with around 9 thousand volunteers set up to provide a better quality of life and to keep hope alive for the less fortunate. She feels very lucky and happy to have her own family now, but she believes that she can still give love to those who don’t.
