Shefali is a mental health advocate and grassroots leader. She found that most people do not seek out information about mental wellbeing because they do not have any mental health issues. 

Shefali also believes that educating others about mental health will help create a more caring society that can better tackle challenges together. Everyone should also take care of their mental wellbeing, just like how they take care of their physical health!
