Shefali is a mental health advocate and grassroots leader. She found that most people do not seek out information about mental well-being because they do not have any mental health issues. 

Shefali also   believes that educating others about mental health will help create a more caring society that can better  tackle challenges together.  Everyone should also take care of their mental well-being, just like they take care of their physical health!
