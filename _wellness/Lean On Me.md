<p>“Lean On Me” is a resident-centred initiative that aims to support and
promote mental wellbeing in our community. Our main goal is to create a
positive and joyful living environment for all.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we have created these pages to serve as a valuable customised
portal. The content has been carefully chosen based on discussions with
residents.</p>

<p>Our subpages offer a variety of things, such as our activities and video
interviews with our own residents sharing their experiences and best practices
on mental wellbeing. These videos aim to reduce the stigma around struggling
and encourage people to seek help when they need it. We hope that this
platform can be a starting point for everyone, providing basic information
on finding relaxation and seeking assistance.</p>
<p>To prioritise our wellbeing as a community, it’s important that we come
together and help those in need. We also invite residents who are interested
to become befrienders. Let’s join forces and embark on this journey together,
promoting a culture of support and compassion. By doing so, we can create
an environment where we all feel valued, cared for, and empowered to overcome
challenges in life.</p>

<p>With a vision to see communities and households genuinely care beyond
what’s on the surface and support each other through life’s ups and downs
- Lean On Me is a mental wellbeing initiative in Holland-Bukit Timah GRC
and Bukit Panjang SMC. All five divisions have come together to help residents
prioritise their wellbeing as a life-long practice, and not just when times
are tough.</p>
