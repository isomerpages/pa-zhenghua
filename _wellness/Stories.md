<p>Angel's journey of helping friends with mental health issues began in
Primary 4, when she supported a friend who was self-harming and engaging
in dangerous online challenges. This experience had a profound impact on
Angel, who began to experience her own mental health challenges. In Primary
6, Angel's struggles came to a head when she began to have thoughts of
self-harm. Initially, she was scared to reach out to her mother, but to
her surprise, her mother was understanding and supportive. She even found
a psychologist to work through her issues. Today, Angel is doing better,
and she is both supporting and being supported by her family and friends.</p>
