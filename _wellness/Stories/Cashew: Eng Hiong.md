He believes that as our population ages, we need to be more prepared to take care of each other, especially seniors living alone. He encourages us to talk about mental health issues more openly so that people can better understand them. We also need to be more accepting and sensitive to each other's needs. Finally, we should reach out to people who are struggling, even if it is just to offer a listening ear.</p>
