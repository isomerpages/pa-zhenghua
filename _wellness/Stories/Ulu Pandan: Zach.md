Zach felt overwhelmed by academic pressure in upper primary school. He felt like he never had time to relax, even on school holidays! This led to burnout, and he started using harmful coping mechanisms in lower secondary school. 

When Zachâ€™s partner became worried about him, he realised the need to take better care of his mental wellbeing. He now consciously sets time to breathe and takes mental health breaks throughout the day. With professional help, he is more equipped to cope with his mental wellbeing and emotions.
