<p>Yong Feeh is a dedicated father, husband, and Chairman of Zhenghua’s Community
Emergency &amp; Engagement Committee Council EXCO. His parenting journey
with his daughter excelling as an associate psychologist and his son thriving
in his learning journey in Computer Science has been fulfilling.
<br>
<br>By prioritising inclusion, respecting their choices, and fostering open
communication, he and his wife created a supportive environment at home.
Actively engaging with their children’s friends strengthened their parent-child
bond too. Personally, cycling through nature and hitting the gym keeps
him mentally and physically fit.
<br>
<br>Parenthood isn’t about meeting standards but embracing the journey with
an open heart. He advises future parents to seek guidance, stay present,
and cherish every moment. Join him in embracing the beautiful chaos of
parenthood—it's truly a remarkable adventure!
