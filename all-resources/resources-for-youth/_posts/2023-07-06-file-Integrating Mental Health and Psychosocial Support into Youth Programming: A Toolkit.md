# Integrating Mental Health and Psychosocial Support into Youth Programming A Toolkit
This Integrating Mental Health and Psychosocial Support into Youth Programming: A Toolkit provides strategies and tools for designing, implementing, and evaluating mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) programs and activities for youth in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and conflict affected contexts. The Toolkit is a resource for standalone youth MHPSS programs and MHPSS activities that are integrated into cross-sectoral youth-focused programs (e.g., health, gender and gender-based violence or GBV, workforce development/youth employment, education, violence prevention, peace, and stability, etc.). The Toolkit includes guidance based on good practice for MHPSS, with recommendations for adapting program designs to community needs and the local context.
