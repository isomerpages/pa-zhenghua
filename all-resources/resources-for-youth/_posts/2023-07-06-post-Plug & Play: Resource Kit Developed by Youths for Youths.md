# Plug & Play: Resource Kit Developed by Youths for Youths
Through conversations with our stakeholders in the Institutes of Higher Learning, NCSS realised that many youths are passionate about generating awareness on mental health and addressing stigma associated with mental health conditions. However, they do not have the necessary knowledge, content and resources to kickstart their own anti-stigma initiatives within their peers and school. Hence, NCSS has decided to codevelop this toolkit with Youth Alliance and youths from Youth Corps Singapore, this toolkit contains activities that youths can adapt for their own use, resources and tips on how to kickstart their own anti-stigma initiatives.
