# Understanding the Quality of Life of Adults with Mental Health Issues
<!--br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->NCSS conducted the Quality of Life Study on Persons with Mental Health Issues in Singapore. This survey targeted persons with mental health issues who are or have accessed social support, and is the first study carried out for this group that focuses on their quality of life and what they consider important to their well-being. These findings support existing knowledge and feedback, and help NCSS represent the views of persons with mental health issues. NCSS will also reference them for deeper solutioning, research, service planning efforts, public education and policy recommendations.
